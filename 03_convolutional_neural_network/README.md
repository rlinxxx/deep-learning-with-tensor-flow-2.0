# Convolutional Neural Networks

Here, we study the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which applies kernel filters in the data in order to compute the convolutions. Those kernel filters can be also applied with strides, that defines the amount of movement between applications of the filters. 

We also analyse another concepts relevant to the topic, such as:

* Max and Average Pooling: acts downsampling the input representation by taking the maximum value or the average value over a spatial window of size;
* Dropout: the Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting;
* Batch Normalization: a Batch Normalization layer will calculate the mean and standard deviation on the current batch of data, acting as a form of regularization that prevents overfitting (such as Dropout);
* Data Augmentation: it is a technique to increase the diversity of the training set by applying random transformations.
